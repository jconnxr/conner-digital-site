                John helps you figure out what matters online first—then builds or fixes the site, tightens how leads
                reach you, and sets up ads and tools that fit a local business (not a corporate playbook). From the first
                call through launch, you work with the same person who answers the phone and does the work.

                Most owners I meet aren&apos;t behind because they don&apos;t care—they&apos;re behind because the
                online side piled up: an outdated site, scattered reviews, leads lost in texts and voicemails, ads that
                never quite paid off. I focus on the basics that move the needle: look trustworthy when someone Googles
                you, make it easy to call or book, and keep follow-up from falling through the cracks.

                Whether you&apos;re in a small town or the Oklahoma City metro, you get practical help in plain
                language—websites, CRMs, and advertising wired together so your online presence supports how you actually
                run the business. I scope honestly, ship in focused phases, and don&apos;t disappear after launch.

                Conner Digital is a Christian company. That means straight answers, fair pricing, and treating your reputation
                online like something worth protecting—because for local businesses, what people see and read about you
                often happens before you ever shake hands.
